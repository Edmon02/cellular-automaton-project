### Professional Integration
```python
from src.rules import OptimizedRules
from src.simulation import Simulation

# Professional pattern for high-performance simulation
sim = Simulation(500, 500)  # Large grid
sim.add_entities_random(1000)  # Many entities

# Use optimized batch processing
result = sim.step_optimized()
print(f"Processed {result.total_moves:,} moves in {result.simulation_time:.4f}s")
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
with sim.performance_timer():
    # Your simulation code here
    sim.step_optimized()

print(f"Performance: {sim.stats.total_moves / sim.stats.simulation_time:,.0f} moves/second")
```
